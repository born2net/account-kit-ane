# Account Kit | Native extension for Adobe AIR (iOS &amp; Android)

[Account Kit](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/accountkit/overview) helps people quickly and easily register and log into your app using their phone number or email address as a passwordless credential. Account Kit is powered by Facebook's email and SMS sending infrastructure for reliable scalable performance with global reach. Using email and phone number authentication doesn't require a Facebook account, and is the ideal alternative to a social login.

Development of this extension is supported by [Master Tigra, Inc.](https://github.com/mastertigra)
